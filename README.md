Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Vehicle_length, ground_clearance and intercept provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the data set and contributed to a slope that is not equal to zero, shown by the P-values not equaling zero.

The multiple R-squared outcome provides a tested prediction rate of effective mpg estimates and considering this value equals 0.7149, our model predicts 71% accuracy.

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

then briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition.
Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
In your description, address the following questions:
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
